=== Create ERC20 Send Request
Creates ERC20 send request with specified parameters. Either `client_id` or `chain_id`, `redirect_url` and
`token_address` must be provided as request body parameters. `sender_address`, `arbitrary_data`, `screen_config` and all
its child fields are optional. `arbitrary_data` field can contain any desired JSON value. Send request ID can be
interpolated into the `redirect_url` by placing `${id}` placeholder in the place where request ID is desired in the URL.
The placeholder must strictly have dollar sign and brackets to be interpolated, and only `id` field can be interpolated.

Example request using `client_id` field:

.Response

Example request using `chain_id`, `redirect_url` and `token_address` fields:
