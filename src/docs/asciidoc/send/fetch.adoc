=== Fetch ERC20 Send Request by ID
Fetches stored ERC20 send request with its current status. Possible statuses are `PENDING`, `SUCCESS` and `FAILED`. The
request is considered successful if the attached transaction is confirmed on blockchain and all its data matches
specified request parameters (correct `to` and `from` addresses, `amount`, matching `data` and `txHash`). If there are
any mismatches between specified request data and state on blockchain, the request will be marked as failed. If there is
no attached transaction hash or if transaction for attached hash is not yet mined on blockchain, request will be in
pending state.

Custom RPC URL can be specified via optional `X-RPC-URL` header - this will NOT override the default RPC URL for the
specified chain ID, it only allows you to specify RPC URL for non-natively supported chains. To override the default RPC
URL, use `X-RPC-URL-OVERRIDE` header.
