=== Fetch ERC20 Balance Check Request by ID
Fetches stored ERC20 balance check request with its current status. The request is considered successful if the attached
signed message is valid and was signed by `wallet_address`. If `wallet_address` was not specified when the request was
created, then any valid signature will be accepted. For successful requests, `balance` field will contain info about
requested ERC20 balance. For pending requests, `balance` and `signed_message` fields will always be `null`. If the
signed message is invalid or does not match specified `wallet_address`, request will be considered as failed. If
`block_number` was specified during request creation, then ERC20 balance will be fetched only for that block number, and
if `block_number` was not specified then the latest ERC20 balance will be fetched every time this resource is requested.

Custom RPC URL can be specified via optional `X-RPC-URL` header - this will NOT override the default RPC URL for the
specified chain ID, it only allows you to specify RPC URL for non-natively supported chains. To override the default RPC
URL, use `X-RPC-URL-OVERRIDE` header.
